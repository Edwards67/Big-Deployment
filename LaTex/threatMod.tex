The 'Weather and Jokes' web application employs Kubernetes and NGINX within its architecture to provide defenses against several cybersecurity threats. 
We are specifically defending against unauthorized access, SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. 
These measures are crucial for maintaining both the integrity and availability of our services and for ensuring that user data remains secure against potential exploitation.
In contemplating the perceived capabilities of potential attackers, we recognize that they are likely to possess a high degree of technical sophistication, equipped with the skills necessary to exploit vulnerabilities typical of web applications. 
These attackers might use advanced techniques for SQL injections, craft XSS attacks, and leverage automated tools to execute DoS attacks.

To counter these threats, our application utilizes a load balancer within the Kubernetes environment to effectively manage traffic volumes that could potentially lead to DoS attacks. 
This load balancer helps distribute incoming traffic evenly across available servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed
Additionally, NGINX, configured as a reverse proxy, is pivotal in safeguarding against unauthorized access and filtering out malicious requests. It acts as a gatekeeper, routing all incoming traffic through its server and using ModSecurity-a web application firewall(Talked more about later)â€”to identify and block threats identified from patterns typical in SQL injections and XSS. 
Moreover, NGINX enhances the security of user sessions by managing encrypted connections, a crucial feature for preventing session hijacking. 
These encrypted channels ensure that session tokens, critical for maintaining user session integrity, are not intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties.
Through the strategic implementation of Kubernetes and NGINX, the 'Weather and Jokes' application is well-prepared to defend against a spectrum of cybersecurity threats.
