To enhance the security of our web server environment, we implemented a robust mechanism for gathering and logging IP addresses. This approach involves capturing IP addresses attempting 
to access our server on ports other than 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) and maintaining comprehensive logs for further analysis. The IP gathering mechanism is designed to identify unauthorized access 
attempts by capturing IP addresses that try to connect to non-standard ports. This is achieved through a script that utilizes tcpdump to monitor network traffic and filter out unwanted connections. 
The captured IP addresses are stored in a cumulative list, which can be used to block malicious IPs via IP tables. In addition to gathering IP addresses, we implemented an hourly logging mechanism to 
maintain detailed records of network activity. This involves running a script that logs all IP traffic, excluding ports 22 and 80, and saves the logs with timestamps. These logs provide valuable data 
for analyzing traffic patterns and identifying potential security threats. To ensure the effectiveness of our IP gathering and logging mechanisms, the captured IP addresses and logs are periodically 
reviewed. This verification process involves accessing the log files to confirm that the security measures are functioning as intended and to identify any anomalies in network traffic.
