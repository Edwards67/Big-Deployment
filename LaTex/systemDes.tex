We implemented our website using a Dockerfile Our Website is called ‘Weather and Jokes’, and includes four pages: Home, Contact, FTP Manual, and Login. The Home page runs two services, ‘Get a Joke’ and ‘Weather Checking’. The Contact page lists each of our team members and their roles within the group. The FTP Manual page gives instructions to our team members on how to use FTP.The final page, Login, takes in user input and redirects back to the login page. 

The FTP Manual page is meant to be a distraction for threat actors and is not fundamental to the actual Website, but rather a ploy to try and catch attackers attempting to use FTP and the login page never actually connects to any backend service, this page is used to try and catch potential threat actors attempting to use attacks such as SQL Injections. These features act more as a honeypot gathering information on potential attackers so our defense team can block their IP's.
